                                    Students can get knowledge about the admission eligibility criteria of each state from the Information Bulletin provided at the MCC/State counselling website. But taking knowledge for all stateâ€™s eligibility criteria is too time consuming and is not enough to get admission. Even after going through this information bulletin, you will be having some queries which can only be sought out by a counsellor or a consultancy.
